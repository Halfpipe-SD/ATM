## Project Background

This repository is the combined work of a group of five students during the second semester of the Software Design course.
We were given the ATM code from [DanH957](https://github.com/DanH957/ATM-Machine) and various tasks like fixing errors, implementing features and writing documentation.


## New Code and Documentation

After carefully looking into the old ATM code, we decided to completely rewrite the program.
For the documentation we used [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to automatically generate a website from markdown files with GitHub Actions.
